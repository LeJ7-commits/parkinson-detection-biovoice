# Parkinson’s Detection (BioVoice)

This repository contains a machine learning project on detecting Parkinson’s disease using voice-based features (BioVoice).  
The project includes exploratory analysis, model development, evaluation, and presentation materials.

---

## Project Goals
- Build and evaluate ML models to classify Parkinson’s vs non-Parkinson’s from voice-related features
- Compare baseline and stronger models (where applicable)
- Report performance using standard classification metrics (e.g., accuracy, ROC-AUC, confusion matrix)
